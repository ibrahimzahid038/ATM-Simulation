# ATM-Simulation

A ATM Simulation which you can use to check your balance, deposit money, and withdraw funds — all through a clear, easy-to-use menu. The program models the account using a small class, so the logic is  easy to understand, and it even remembers your balance between runs by saving it to a file. It’s a practical project that teaches the basics of object-oriented design, input validation, and file I/O, while giving you a realistic, hands-on way to practice building user-facing programs.
